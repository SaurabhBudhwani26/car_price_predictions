# car_price_predictions

ML project for prediction of price of used cars


car data.csv contains the dataset used for training the model

Random forest regressor is used to train the model by selecting the parameters using RandomizedSearchCV.

car_price.ipynb file contains the jupyter code for the model.

I have deployed this model in the heroku app with help of making app.py using flask in spyder IDE

link for heroku app is: https://car-price-prediction-26.herokuapp.com/
